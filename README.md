Welcome to my Classical Laminate Theory (CLT) project for the course "Application of Fiber Composites in Structural Engineering" taught by Prof. Masoud Motavalli at the University of Tehran. This project focuses on exploring the principles and applications of CLT in analyzing the mechanical behavior of fiber composite laminates.

## Project Overview

In this project, I have studied the theory of CLT and applied it to analyze the design and mechanical properties of fiber composite laminates. By considering the stacking sequence, material properties, and load conditions, I have gained insights into stress distribution, failure modes, and overall laminate performance.

## Requirements

Before running the project, make sure to install the required packages listed in the [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt) file. This project requires Python 3.11.0 or compatible versions. You can use the following command to install the dependencies:


```pip install -r requirements.txt```
